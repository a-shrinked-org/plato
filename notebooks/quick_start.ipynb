    "# Platogram: Quick Start\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Using this Notebook you can transform a an audio from YouTube or any source (Google Drive, Fathom, etc.) into paragraphs that spark joy. The resulting text is intended to be a lossless readable representation of the original audio, and will contain references to original transcript of the audio. You will also get summary and title.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally you can store the results in the library and prompt it to generate new content with references to the original audio and transcript, or query it to retrieve paragraphs and underlying transcript.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used the text of Chapter 1: Atoms in Motion from Volume 1. of Feynman's Lectures on Physics and a corresponding transcript obtained from https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/ as an example and reached out to Cal Tech for clarifications about fair use of the material. We observed high-quality output on single-speaker as well as multi-speaker audio in domains of eduction, family law, and business.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Request for Feedback\n",
    "We are looking for your feedback on the quality of the output for your use case and your suggestions on how to improve Platogram. Please reach out to us at platogram@codeanyway.com or ping Artyom in [Telegram](https://t.me/astaff239).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "To use this notebook you need:\n",
    "1. Anthropic API key. You can create one here: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys\n",
    "2. (Optional) If subtitles are not available, you will need an Assembly AI API key for transcription. You can create one here: https://www.assemblyai.com/app/\n",
    "\n",
    "## Costs\n",
    "* Indexing is about $0.75 per hour of audio using Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet model.\n",
    "* Transcription is about $0.37 per hour of audio using Assembly AI Best model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "* `URL`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and optionally `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY` variables below to the URL of the audio source you want to transform.\n",
    "* Update API keys in the first cell.\n",
    "* Run the notebook by clicking \"Run All\" button above."
