    "Using this Notebook you can transform a an audio from YouTube or any source (Google Drive, Fathom, etc.) into paragraphs that spark joy. The resulting text is intended to be a lossless readable representation of the original audio, and will contain references to original transcript of the audio. You will also get summary and title.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally you can store the results in the library and prompt it to generate new content with references to the original audio and transcript, or query it to retrieve paragraphs and underlying transcript.\n",

    "We used the text of Chapter 1: Atoms in Motion from Volume 1. of Feynman's Lectures on Physics and a corresponding transcript obtained from https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/ as an example and reached out to Cal Tech for clarifications about fair use of the material. We observed high-quality output on single-speaker as well as multi-speaker audio in domains of eduction, family law, and business.\n",

       "This commencement speech challenges the \"follow your dreams\" cliché, offering practical advice for career success. It emphasizes adding value to others, adapting to change, and viewing passion as a starting point rather than a fixed goal. The speaker encourages graduates to remain flexible, seek emerging opportunities, and recognize their potential to influence younger generations.\n",
       "## Summary\n",
       "In this commencement speech, the speaker, known for creating math visualization videos, offers a nuanced perspective on the common advice to \"follow your dreams.\" He emphasizes the importance of adding value to others, recognizing that passion alone is not enough for career success. The speaker advises graduates to remain adaptable, seek opportunities in emerging fields, and understand that their interests and goals may change over time. He also highlights the impact one can have on younger generations and the importance of being responsive to a changing world. The speech concludes by encouraging graduates to view passion as a starting point rather than a fixed destination, and to focus on creating value, taking action, and remaining flexible in their pursuits.\n",
